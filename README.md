# RClone Implementation
Documentation for implementing RClone in Tencent Cloud in product backlog [#600](https://github.com/gigascience/gigadb-website/issues/600).

### Important documents
1. GigaDB Backup Transition Plan [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IzM-FkFC5xTQQIsWHWiQmzPFELiWP6Ud1tNuOznc7qo/edit#heading=h.g6xlputqtuim)
2. GigaDB Backup Procedure [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YkiEGdB7gd7wkRZQpFKWPZ2yIxvN4K4GSamd13JxOg0/edit#heading=h.pfibwdizyks3)

### Steps
1. Check VPN access  
    - Log in `GlobalProtect` using BGI username and password.
    - Input `OTP`
2. Log in `smoc` account using BGI username and password, [link](https://smoc.genomics.cn/shterm/login) 
    - Scan the QR code using an Authenticator, like `Google Authenticator` for the first time    
    - Enter the code provided by the Authenticator
    - Download and install `AccessClient` tool locally
    - `xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine <app>` to grant the permission to open  
3. Log in cngb server using `AccessClient`

### Backup plan
1. Sync data in cngb server to tencent cloud  
Since `10.50.11.48` server has mounted GigaDBâ€™s dataset files which are located on `192.168.56.61` server into the local `/data/gigadb` directory
Source: `/data/gigadb`  
Destination: `/cngb/giga/gigadb`  

2. Sync cngb data with local NAS  

3. Sync NAS data to cloud for deployment

kencho@MacBook-Pro:/Volumes/kencho/rclone-implementation (main=) % rclone sync -h

Sync the source to the destination, changing the destination
only.  Doesn't transfer unchanged files, testing by size and
modification time or MD5SUM.  Destination is updated to match
source, including deleting files if necessary (except duplicate
objects, see below).

**Important**: Since this can cause data loss, test first with the
`--dry-run` or the `--interactive`/`-i` flag.

    rclone sync -i SOURCE remote:DESTINATION

Note that files in the destination won't be deleted if there were any
errors at any point.  Duplicate objects (files with the same name, on
those providers that support it) are also not yet handled.

It is always the contents of the directory that is synced, not the
directory so when source:path is a directory, it's the contents of
source:path that are copied, not the directory name and contents.  See
extended explanation in the `copy` command above if unsure.

If dest:path doesn't exist, it is created and the source:path contents
go there.

**Note**: Use the `-P`/`--progress` flag to view real-time transfer statistics

**Note**: Use the `rclone dedupe` command to deal with "Duplicate object/directory found in source/destination - ignoring" errors.
See [this forum post](https://forum.rclone.org/t/sync-not-clearing-duplicates/14372) for more info.

Usage:
  rclone sync source:path dest:path [flags]

Flags:
      --create-empty-src-dirs   Create empty source dirs on destination after sync
  -h, --help                    help for sync

Use "rclone [command] --help" for more information about a command.
Use "rclone help flags" for to see the global flags.
Use "rclone help backends" for a list of supported services.
